Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have used thrilldata.com to get my data and import it into a text file. The data includes attraction names as well as the wait time for the attraction at the start of the hour based off of historical trends. I began implementing this data into the program as well.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

Once finished implementing the data, I need to create the user interface that allows the user to pick what they like the most (ride, dining, etc.). I also want to create some sort of FastPass system, however I do not know if I will have enough time to implement that. 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

The data itself was a huge problem. Trying to figure out which data was the best, how to collect it, and where to find it was tough. I had already known about thrill data, and they have been extremely useful in choosing the data. Still though, figuring out which set of data to use for the wait times took some time and thought.
