## Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

## I either want to do some sort of RPG game using an engine like Unity or a text based adventure game within just the regular IDLE workspace or I want to do something with a simulation relating to Disney World where you can insert information about yourself / your trip through a file and the program will create a perfect day for you based off of information of that day.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

## I want to work by myself

## Do you have any questions of your own?

## Does the video we have to submit at the end have to be anything fancy? Or can it just be like a video going over / running the program
