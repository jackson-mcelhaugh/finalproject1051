# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

## The Disney World Simulation

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

## A program that simulates a day at Disney World for the user through different factors and scenarios.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

## I want to build a program that creates a simulation of a day at Disney World. This will take into account the date (peak time vs non peak time) number of guests entering the park and individual guest profiles. This would allow for different statistics to be displayed to the user such as highest wait times for different ride, best time to go, etc. The user would also be able to implement which day of the year they are going which would change the outcomes of the program. If able to be completed in a timely manner, I would also maybe want to input a way to have a user input what they would like to do and have the day be planned out for them. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

## N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

## Be able to complete a small list of rides in the park with a specified day of the year or just "Peak vs Non-Peak"

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

## Have all of the rides at the park as well as giving the user the ability to pick their date.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

## Allow the user to also implement what they would like to do in, say a file, and have that go into effect. I think this might be a little unrealistic and would rather focus on the rest of the program first.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

## I think the biggest thing I have to work on will be looking into how simulations work and how to run them. I think from this, I will need to put in a lot of brute force programming however, I do think that using functions will help a lot. I also want to work on messing with file reading to try to store all of the information needed in a file instead of within the code. I believe this would make the program a little more "simple" per say, however it might be harder to implement, so I think a lot of experimenting will help.
